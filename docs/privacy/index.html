<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective date: 26 September 2024</p>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. Our app helps you track orders and manage contacts and orders.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information. Authentication is handled by Firebase. No sensitive user
  information is stored on our servers.</p>

<h2>2. Firebase</h2>
<p>We use Firebase as our backend service. Firebase authentication and database services are used to handle login and
  store order data. Firebase may collect some information according to their own <a
    href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Contact and Order Management</h2>
<p>Our app allows you to manage your contacts and track orders. This data is securely stored in Firebase Firestore, and
  no additional user information is collected or shared.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<p>Your order and contact data will be stored until you delete your account or uninstall the app.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>We implement security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100%
  secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated
  effective date.</p>
